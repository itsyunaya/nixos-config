# Introduction
This is an experimental configuration using home manager and flakes I made to gather experience and explore the possibilities of NixOS. It is in currently in a usable, but unstable state, and should probably not be used as a primary configuration.

It is largely based on my current Fedora Linux setup.

A few key features include:
- Kitty terminal with zsh shell and custom prompt
- a preconfigured Hyprland instance
- custom Waybar
- other useful tools

## Note
The repository structure will likely soon undergo big structural changes, as to declutter the `configuration.nix` main file and split up the contents into modules.
